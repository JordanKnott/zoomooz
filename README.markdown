## Information


A fork of [zoomooz](https://github.com/jaukia/zoomooz) that uses scroll based events rather than clicks.


## Building

There is an optional build process. Currently the only thing it does is that it merges and minifies Javascript files, so running it is not necessary.

### Setting up the build tools

1. Download and install Node.js (npm should install automatically):

  http://nodejs.org/#download
    
2. Install grunt and requirements for it:

        cd src
        npm install grunt
        grunt
        (install any missing requirements based on instructions)

### Running the build

    cd src
    grunt
